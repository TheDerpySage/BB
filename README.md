BB
===========
BB is my latest python discord bot written using Discord.py. She functions pimarily as a server monitor for my home network, she includes an automated process for checking the health of certain servers so I may be alerted of downtime. She also runs some administrative tasks on my server.

DEPENDENCIES
=============
Python 3.7.4

pip install discord.py

NOTES
=============
BB is primarily written to run in a Linux enviornment (she runs on a Raspberry Pi at home).

The "temp.py" files must be edited and the underscore temp removed from the
name before the application will run.

TO-DO
=============
Incremental changes at this point.
