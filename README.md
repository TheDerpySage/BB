# BB - Generic

This is a generic bot with some of the features of BB that can be redeployed in other places. 

## DEPENDENCIES

Python 3.9

pip install -r requirements.txt

## NOTES

BB is primarily written to run in a Linux enviornment (she runs on a Raspberry Pi at home).

The "temp.py" files must be edited and the underscore temp removed from the
name before the application will run.

### TO-DO

Continue to improve turbo.
